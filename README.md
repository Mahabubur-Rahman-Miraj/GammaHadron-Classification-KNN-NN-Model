# GammaHadron-Classification-KNN-NN-Model
This project focuses on classifying gamma and hadron particles using the MAGIC Gamma Telescope dataset. It involves data preprocessing, feature scaling, and model training using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and a Neural Network (NN). The models are evaluated to determine the best approach for accurate classification.
